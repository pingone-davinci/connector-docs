# ConnectID Connector

Author: Peter Holko


# Introduction

ConnectID is a new, secure way to verify your customers’ identity. ConnectID acts as an identity exchange offering a simple and secure way for your customers to prove who they are, using an organisation they already trust. 

Your customers will be able to use a trusted institution, like their bank, to verify themselves and share their data directly with your business via a secure API. ConnectID does not see or store your customer’s personal information at any time. 

The ConnectID connector in PingOne DaVinci can be used to request verification of a customer's identity via the ConnectID service.
