# Svipe Connector

Author: Svipe

# Introduction
You can use the Svipe Connector to create applications with strong authentication, which will improve security by verifying identities of usersâ€™ ID credentials from biometric id-documents issued by 145+ countries.

The SvipeID app has to be downloaded on the user's device in order to use the connector.
The user has to go through the fast onboarding process.

Svipe Connector can be used for:
Strong authentication

Svipe issues all identity credentials as JWT and W3C-compliant verified credential identity claims.
