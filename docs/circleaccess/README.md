# Circle Access Connector

Author: Circle Systems

# Introduction

The Circle Access connector provides user authentication through the Circle Access Service and provides the user session information,
as well as the hash of emails, that can be used by other connectors for user control and validation.

## Use cases

A common use case is to enable credential-free authentication for your current end users.
This allows your end users to access your Web application and/or server from any public (or private) computer and browser while eliminating any possibility of the user's credentials being stolen or hijacked.  
The user authenticates by scanning a QR code on their smartphone, with no need to type in any information.

Another popular use case is to enable easy and fast log-in for users that are already registered.
In this case, the user has registered their email with you, so you just need to get the hash of your current user and compare it with the hashes returned from the Circle Access connector.

For new users, Circle Access allows rapid and secure sign-ups, as the hash of the email is always available after the QrCode scan. This means that you can just request the email once and use the login scan to confirm it, without the need to send information or requests to the user's email. Once confirmed, you just save the information and let the user in.

This method is secure on any public (or private) computer and browser because - even if the computer is compromised - the only information that is exposed is the user email, while the hashes and session information are delivered securely and directly to your connector.
